# Board-SmartGames
<b>Java</b> program to play up to 3 games. Developed using <b>MVC (Model View Controller)</b> pattern and <b>Swing</b> for GUI (Graphical User Interface). Made for the Programming Technology subject at <b>Universidad Complutense de Madrid</b>.

## Choose your favourite game!
You can play up to three nice and cool games: <b>Tic Tac Toe</b>, <b>Wolf And Sheep</b> and <b>Chess</b>. Each game have different mechanics (the most difficult one is the Chess :P).

* **Tic Tac Toe**: is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
* **Wolf And Sheep**: Sheep and Wolf is a nice, deceivingly simple game for children. There are two players in the game: one handles the white sheep and the second handles the wolf. The game is played on a board of checkers (8 x 8, neighbouring squares have opposite colours).

  Initially the 5 sheep and the wolf are positioned on the black squares. The 5 sheep are all positioned on the bottom row. The wolf can start at any field that her/his player likes. All pieces can make only diagonal moves to an adjacent square. The sheep can march only forward, the wolf can walk backwards and forwards. Alternating one sheep moves and then the wolf makes a step. The sheep win when the wolf can not make a legal move anymore, for instance, when they have encircled the wolf completely. The wolf wins when he manages to break through the line of sheep and reaches the bottom row. The wolf must make the first move.
* **Chess**: Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide.

## Smart and automatic players
Are you bored because nobody wants to play with you? No problem! We've created an awesome feature that allows you to use an "automatic player" that will place a disc in a position of the board.

### Alpha-beta pruning (smart player algorithm)
<b>Alpha–beta pruning</b> is a <b>search algorithm</b> that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the <b>minimax algorithm</b> in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games.  <b>It stops completely evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move</b>. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
